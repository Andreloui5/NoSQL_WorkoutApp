# NoSQL_WorkoutApp

This application is designed to allow a user to continually track their fitness goals and to view their workout data in various forms.

## Interface
At the homepage, a user is prompted to either continue an ongoing workout or to begin a new one. They are then asked abou the details of the workout they'd like to enter. Some of the data entered is immediately visible on the homepage (like the cumulative duration of a workout), while more data is presented by the charts on our user dashboard.
